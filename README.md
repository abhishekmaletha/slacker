The index provides an add to cart button which redirects to the slack login UI. If the user is not already logged in, then UI provides sign-in/sign-up else the list of workspace and associated channels and contacts are displayed. The user selects the channel or contact and is redirected to the web-hosted end point. This completes the integration process.

Add to slack button sends a request containing scopes, client ID, client secret, redirect uri to slack api which then provides UI for the user to log-in or sign-up. Once the access is allowed by the user by selecting the workspace and channel, a code is generated and a request is made to oAuth2.0 requesting access token and webhook URL.
